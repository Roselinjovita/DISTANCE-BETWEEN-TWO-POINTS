# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS


## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
A progran to find distance between two points

### Step 2: 
Get the input values

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)

### Step 4: 
After substituting the values enter the formula

### Step 5:
End the program 

### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2)))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:
